# NavigationDashboardFollowAlong

## Another Follow-Along WPF project.
This code is not my own. I found a YouTube video of the creator making this project in a timelapse. I just followed along with the video. The point of this was to get more familiar with WPF. This was a useful exercise as it exposed me to another style of writing XAML which I definitely prefer (I'm referring to each property of a tag being on its own line after the first one) as well as some already-implemented MVVM. Maybe one or two more of these and I'll feel good to branch off and start designing my own UI's with MVVM... I have a neat dashboard-style Data Structures and Algorithms app planned.

#### TODO
Clean up code!
